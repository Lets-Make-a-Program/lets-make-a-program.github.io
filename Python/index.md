# Let's Make a Program in *Python*
Python is a hugely popular scripting language that can run on just about anything.  If you want to learn without
downloading anything, Python is a good place to start because of the slew of in-browser Python editors out there.

## Getting Set Up
One of the beauties of Python is that it's a lightweight language that can run without a lot of overhead.  As a result,
you have a few options when it comes to writing Python.  The two basic options are to either A) download and install a
code editor or B) use a website that will interpret your Python code directly in the browser.  There are many possible
options, but the two I would recommend are:

- Use [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/) and write Python in your browser.  You can save your code to a URL
in order to come back to it later or share with others, which is very handy.
- Download and install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) from Microsoft.
I program primarily in C#, but VS is free, powerful, and can be used to program in many languages, including Python.
- For a smaller, lighter editor, you could use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Like its older,
bigger brother, VS Code can be used to program many different languages.  If you get used to using it for Python, you
can easily add components to program in other languages as well.
