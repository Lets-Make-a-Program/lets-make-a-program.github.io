# Welcome to _Let's Make a Program_

Years ago, I learned to make a simple video game by following a tutorial that slowly built the game from scratch.  It didn't get academic and teach me definitions, it didn't explain some huge plan, it just let me get right into it.  It even made mistakes along the way that you had to go back and fix.

The point of this site is to make tutorials like that - ones where you jump right in, make mistakes, and learn by doing.
