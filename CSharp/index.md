# Let's Make a Program in *C#*
C# is my bread and butter.  It's a powerful modern language created by Microsoft, who also gives their dev tools away for
free for individual use.  I've used it longer than any other language, so you can expect more C# tutorials here than
anything else.

## Getting Set Up
You'll want to download and install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
from Microsoft before following any C# tutorials.  You can find online code editors, but VS includes so many helpful 
features that will make your life so much easier.

As a bonus, it will prepare you to work with that same tool if you get hired to work at a place that uses C#!

## Programs
