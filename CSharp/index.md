# Let's Make a Progra - C#
//TODO: Introduce C# briefly

### Getting Set Up
You'll want to download and install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
from Microsoft before following any C# tutorials.  You can find online code editors, but VS includes so many helpful 
features that will make your life so much easier.

As a bonus, it will prepare you to work with that same tool if you get hired to work at a place that uses C#!

### Programs
- [Hello World](/CSharp/HelloWorld) - A perfect place to start as a brand new programmer
